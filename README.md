All the things I need for the construction of my digital project on the *Records of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England, Volume 1, 1628-1641* for the work of my PhD Dissertation at Northeastern University.
It's a bit nerve-wracking setting out to do a disseration where I'm going to create a digital project. Life was a lot easier when all I was doing was reading books and talking about them.
Now I'm trying to build a website??
But, I'm confident that the internet (and the university) is full of people who can help me figure out how to do what it is that I want to do.
So, onward!
